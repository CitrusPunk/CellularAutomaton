######different Cellular Automaton in different programming languages 
 
This repository covers my progress in programming Cellular Automaton 
with different programming languages with different graphical outputs from Terminal/CMD to Processing.org. 
If there are any questions, ideas or similiar projects tell me. 
 

I would love to get to know new people interested in that kind of programming. 
 
 
Doc's and InCode-Comments will follow while growing.
